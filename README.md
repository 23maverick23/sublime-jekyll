[sublime-jekyll](http://23maverick23.github.io/sublime-jekyll/) is a [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) package for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static sites.

This package is aimed at streamlining the process of managing and creating new Jekyll posts.

If you use Jekyll as your static site generator, and Sublime Text as your text editor, you should absolutely install and use this package!
