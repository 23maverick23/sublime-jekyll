Thanks for installing sublime-jekyll!

This package should help maintaining Jekyll sites and posts easier by providing access to new post/draft shortcuts, key template tags and filters, as well as common completions and a current date/datetime command (for dating posts).


After installing this package, make sure you configure your User settings file. The most important piece of this is to set your `posts_path` and `drafts_path` locations. This can also be set on a per-project basis later if you have multiple Jekyll sites you wish to manage.

{

    // This should point to your "_posts" directory.
    // NOTE: This should be an absolute path. Also, the path should
    // match your system convention. For example, Windows machines should
    // have a path similar to "C:\\Users\\username\\site\\_posts".
    // *nix systems should have a path similar to "/Users/username/site/_posts".
    "posts_path": "",

    // This should point to your "_drafts" directory.
    // NOTE: This should be an absolute path. Also, the path should
    // match your system convention. For example, Windows machines should
    // have a path similar to "C:\\Users\\username\\site\\_drafts".
    // *nix systems should have a path similar to "/Users/username/site/_drafts".
    "drafts_path": "",

}

```

For per-project settings, make sure you add your Jekyll settings correctly to your project settings file:

{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "follow_symlinks": true,
            "path": "/Users/username/site/"
        }
    ],

    "settings":
    {
        "Jekyll":
        {
            "posts_path": "/Users/username/site/_posts",
            "drafts_path": "/Users/username/site/_drafts",
        }
    }
}
