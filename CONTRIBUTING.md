Contributing
============

I encourage pull requests to make this package more helpful for the ST/Jekyll community. Here's a quick guide I'd prefer you follow when submitting pull requests.

1. [Fork ⇉](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll/fork) this repo
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name `git checkout -b my_feature_or_issue`
3. Commit your changes `git commit -am "Add Feature or Close #123"`
4. Push to the branch `git push origin my_feature_or_issue`
5. Open a [Pull Request ⥆](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll/pulls)

At this point you're waiting on me :wink: . I like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (typically one business day because I love when people contribute). I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives to what you've added, so don't be discouraged if I don't merge immediately.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Follow a good Python style guide, starting with [PEP8][style-pep], and maybe reviewing [Google's style guide][style-google].
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
