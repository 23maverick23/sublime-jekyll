Contributing
============

I'm really glad you're reading this because we encourage anyone and everyone in the Jekyll and Sublime Text communities to contribute to this project.

## Submitting changes

Here's a quick guide we prefer you follow when submitting pull requests.

1. Grab a [Fork of this repo](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll/fork).
2. Create a Branch with a descriptive name (`git checkout -b my_feature_or_issue`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Add Feature or Close #123"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my_feature_or_issue`).
5. Open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll/pull/new/master).

Please send your [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```bash
$ git commit -am "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph or list describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces (soft tabs).
  * We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`) and around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  * We follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) in most cases.
  * We also adhere to [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

Thanks!
